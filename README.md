- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaPossert
- 👀 I’m interested in Information Processing Systems, like RoamResearch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with coders as a non-coder systems architect
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating information storage systems from Calendars and Note-taking Apps to Messaging Services.
- 📫 How to reach me wonderfulconsulting.global@gmail.com

My (coding) principles:
- I contribute to code that has a pathway to sovereignity, meaning 
  - for code (or at least the UI) to be editable by the user 
  - for the data to be private, preferrably encrypted, and always downloadable free of charge (and to be accessible by an open-source or free-ware = no inaccessible data)
